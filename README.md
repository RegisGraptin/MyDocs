## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot](screen.png)

MyDocs is your Web3 Notion - A decentralized, self-sovereign collaboration platform that enables **multiple participants to work together seamlessly across different nodes in real time**. It ensures that users retain full ownership, control, and protection of their data. By combining decentralization with verified off-chain computing, MyDocs eliminates the need for centralized intermediaries, offering a secure, transparent, and efficient environment for data-driven collaboration.

### Built With

- Calimero Network - A framework that enables building and running peer-to-peer Self-Sovereign applications focusing on data ownership and harnessing the power of verified off-chain computing.

- ENS (Ethereum Name Service) - A decentralized domain naming system on Ethereum that maps human-readable names (e.g., alice.eth) to blockchain addresses and other data.
